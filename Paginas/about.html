                            <h1>Our History</h1>
                            <p>BRISA was born when a bunch of university friends came together in order to make great games for their assignatures. After some time those same friends decided it was time to take the step into the industry as professionals, reaching out to other young people who want to have their breakthrough in the videogame industry. We have been developing and publishing incredible indie games since 2022.</p>

                        <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
                        <p>At BRISA we are committed to publishing titles that are fun and meaningful. We care deeply about the games we publish, and we are dedicated to helping developers create experiences that are authentic, innovative, and true to their vision. We care for their projects as much as they do, supporting them through hardships that may come along during the production of a videogame and giving the proper support to the game once it has released. It is thanks to our partners that BRISA is what is today, every one of them is and will always be a part of the BRISA family.</p>
